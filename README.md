# Brief
CSVXLCD (CSV Excel-Like Column Deletion) is a Python-based automation tool designed to process multiple CSV files by removing unwanted columns based on user-defined Excel-style column ranges. This tool simplifies bulk data preprocessing by allowing users to specify column deletions in an intuitive format (e.g., A,F,AO,BD) and automatically processes all files in a given directory.
